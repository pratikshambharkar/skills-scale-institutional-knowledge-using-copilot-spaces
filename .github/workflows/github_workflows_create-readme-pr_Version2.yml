# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

OctoAcme's project management docs collect our workflows, templates, and playbooks so teams can start work quickly and consistently. This README serves as the primary landing page and index for project management docs.

OctoAcme follows a lightweight, repeatable lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Close & Retrospective. Initiation clarifies the problem, measurable goals, stakeholders, and a one-page plan.

Key workflows and roles: teams track work on a project board (Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> In Review -> QA -> Done). Pull requests should be small and include the issue link and acceptance criteria.

Communication and quality assurance: regular rhythms (daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM+PdM alignment, monthly stakeholder updates) keep teams aligned and provide escalation points. QA relies on defined acceptance criteria and testing steps.
